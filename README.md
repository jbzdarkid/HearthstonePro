# HearthstonePro
Parsing hearthstone log files because I can

Language: Python (Yaaay crossplatform!)

Goals: Right now, all I want is to be able to consistently replicate board state.
In the future, I'd like to:
- list cards played
- show possible secret options (and document the dual-secret interactions, like freezing & explosive)
- track information about opponents cards (what turn did they draw the card, is it a known card like The Coin, did it fail Call Pet, etc)
- anything people want that's reasonable
